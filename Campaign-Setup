# Campaign Setup – GoPhish Phishing Awareness Lab

## Purpose
The objective of this campaign was to simulate a phishing attempt within a controlled lab environment to better understand:

- How phishing emails are structured
- Indicators of malicious intent
- User interaction patterns
- Methods for improving organizational security awareness

⚠️ No real users or credentials were involved. Test accounts were used exclusively.

---

## Environment Configuration

**Platform:** GoPhish  
**Host:** Local Linux Machine  
**Admin Interface:** Port 3333  
**Landing Page:** Port 80  

The environment was isolated to prevent unintended external email delivery.

---

## Campaign Components

### Email Template
A simulated notification-style email was created to replicate common phishing tactics such as:

- Sense of urgency  
- Account verification request  
- Embedded hyperlink  

The template was designed for educational analysis rather than deception.

---

### Sending Profile
A test SMTP service was configured to safely send emails to controlled inboxes.

**Configuration Included:**
- SMTP host
- Port
- Authentication
- From address (test domain)

---

### Landing Page
A basic landing page was hosted through GoPhish to track user interaction after link clicks.

**Tracking Enabled:**
- Email opens  
- Link clicks  
- Form submissions (disabled or using dummy fields)

No sensitive data was collected.

---

### User Group
The campaign targeted **test email accounts only** to simulate user behavior without impacting real individuals.

---

## Execution Process

1. Configured sending profile  
2. Built email template  
3. Created a test user group  
4. Launched the campaign  
5. Monitored results through the GoPhish dashboard  

---

## Metrics Observed

The following data points were analyzed:

- Open rate  
- Click-through rate  
- Interaction timeline  

These metrics help security teams understand behavioral risk patterns.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Emails creating urgency tend to increase interaction rates.
- Users should always verify sender domains before clicking links.
- Security awareness training is critical in reducing phishing risk.

---

## Security & Ethical Considerations

This campaign was conducted strictly for:

✅ Educational purposes  
✅ Defensive security training  
✅ Understanding attacker techniques  

The lab followed ethical guidelines and did not involve real targets.

---

## Future Improvements

- Deploy GoPhish in Docker for portability  
- Integrate with a SIEM to simulate alerting  
- Analyze email headers for deeper threat detection  
- Build multiple phishing scenarios for comparison
